ABOUT IFC++
=============

IFC++ is an open source IFC implementation for C++.
It is very fast, but it has not the lowest possible memory footprint, because it has a complete class model.



Benefits of the complete class model are (among others):
- you can easily instantiate objects and access member variables, for example:
```cpp
  shared_ptr<IfcCartesianPoint> ifcPoint = make_shared<IfcCartesianPoint>();
  shared_ptr<IfcPolyLoop> polyLoop = make_shared<IfcPolyLoop>()
  polyLoop->m_Polygon.push_back(ifcPoint);
```

- you can navigate the model easily by accessing member variables directly, including inverse attributes:
```cpp
shared_ptr<IfcBuildingStorey> currentBuildingStorey = ...;
for (auto it : currentBuildingStorey->m_IsDecomposedBy_inverse)
{
   shared_ptr<IfcRelAggregates> relAggregates(it);

   for (auto it2 : relAggregates->m_RelatedObjects)
   {
      shared_ptr<IfcObjectDefinition> child_obj = (it2);
      shared_ptr<IfcWallStandardCase> wall = dynamic_pointer_cast<IfcWallStandardCase>(child_obj);
      if(wall)
      {
         // do something with wall
      }
    }
 }
```
  Inverse attribute pointers are automatically generated by IFC++ for all object references in the model.

- casting is possible for all types:
 ```cpp
  shared_ptr<IfcPropertySet> pset = dynamic_pointer_cast<IfcPropertySet>(relatingPropertyDefinition);
  ```

- Professional support is available for bug fixing or custom implementations on www.ifcquery.com.
