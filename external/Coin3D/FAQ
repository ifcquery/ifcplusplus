Section 1. Extensions and Ports
===============================

Q1.1:   Are there plans for making Coin multi-thread safe?

A:      Coin will probably never be 100% thread safe, but in Coin 2.0
        we've added support for thread safe rendering. This means that
        you can render a scene graph using many threads, at the same
        time. The application programmer is responsible for all thread
        synchronization though, but we've added many thread classes to
        make this easier for you (SbMutex, SbRWMutex, SbStorage,
        SbBarrier, ...).

       
Q1.2:   Can Coin do multi-pipe rendering?

A:      Yes, but you have to do some work. Coin can do thread-safe
        rendering traversals, but we haven't implemented a simple
        viewer that will set up the OpenGL contexts and handle the
        rendering for each context yet. We've done some internal
        testing with SGI's OpenGL Multipipe SDK, and we might release
        a viewer using that SDK.  Please contact us if you're
        interested in multi-pipe rendering.


Q1.3:   Can I do volume rendering with Coin?

A:      Yes, SIM provide an add-on library called "SIM Voleon" for
        volume rendering. The library provides a set of scene graph
        nodes which lets developers set up and visualize volume data
        (in the form of voxels).

        SIM Voleon is available from the same channels as Coin itself,
        i.e. the same FTP site and directory, and the same CVS
        repository (the CVS module is named "SIMVoleon").  SIM Voleon
        requires Coin v2.0 or later, and has a licensing scheme similar
        to Coin.

        See also http://www.sim.no/products/SIM_Voleon/


Q1.4:   Does Coin support VRML97?

A:      Coin 1.* does not support VRML97.  Coin 2.0 and upwards supports it.
        We are not supporting 100% of the VRML97 standard yet, but most
        models will load and display correctly. The main missing features
        are URL loading (there are callbacks that makes it possible for the
        application programmer to fix this though), proper support for
        bindable nodes, and scripting (can also be supported through
        callbacks).

        VRML97 was amended in 2002 with amongst others GeoSpatial and NURBS
        nodes.  You will not find these nodes in Coin 2 yet.


Q1.5:   Is there an MS Visual C++ project I can use to build Coin?

A:      Yes.  We have now developed a system that uses the Autoconf/Automake
        build system to auto-generate a Microsoft Developer Studio project
        and workspace file for building the Coin library.  This setup
        is included with the source code under the directory build/.
        You therefore do not need Cygwin to build Coin any longer.

        If you want to generate the .dsp file directly from the source
        repository yourself, see the file INSTALL about the --with-msvcdsp
        configure option.  For this you need Cygwin installed.


Q1.6:   Is there a Coin port for Mac OS X/Darwin?

A:      Yes, there is full support for Coin, SoQt and SoXt on
        Mac OS X. You can also integrate Coin into Cocoa applications
        directly by using the Sc21 framework. See
        http://www.coin3d.org/mac/ for Mac-specific information, build
        instructions, download links and tutorials.


Q1.7:   Is Coin compatible with .NET?

A:      The Coin3D libraries are written in C and C++. The supported
        compilers in the Visual Studio family are VisualC++ v6, 
        VisualC++.NET 2003 and Visual C++ .NET 2005. In-house, we mostly
        use VC++.NET 2005.

        Coin3D is currently not a .NET assembly or component, so if
        you'd like to use Coin3D from other languages in the
        VisualStudio family (C#, VB, J#), you will need to do some
        C++ coding first (basically add support for Managed
        Extensions directly, or add some new (managed) classes that
        act as external interfaces to Coin3D). We are probably going
        to make a .NET assembly of Coin3D some time, but we
        haven't had sufficient customer demand for it yet.


Section 2. Common Problems 
==========================

Q2.1:   <Node>::classTypeId != SoType::badType() && "You forgot init()"?

A:      If you get this assert, it means the run-time type system in
        Coin was not initialized at the time a <Node> object is constructed.

        This can happen for several reasons:
        - you haven't called SoDB::init() yet when you construct a node.
        - you have a global node that is constructed automatically on startup
          before main is run.
        - [VC++] you have linked multiple instances of the Coin library into
          your application or the Coin library and the application or some
          other library are using different C library instances.

        In the case of not calling SoDB::init(), it is clearly stated on
        page 36 of The Inventor Mentor that "SoDB::init() must be the first
        Inventor call you make.".

        "But this works with SGI Inventor", I hear you say...  Actually,
        that is just pure luck.  Try e.g. creating a new SoBlinker node,
        and you will see your application going down in flames.


Q2.2:   Why doesn't it work properly to render the same scene graph in two
        different windows?

A:      The reason is probably that the two windows do not share the same
        GL context, but the render actions are not set up with different
        cache contexts.  Use two different values with
        SoGLRenderAction::setCacheContext() for the two windows' render
        actions.  Example follows:

          for (int i=0; i < NR_VIEWERS; i++) {
            SoGLRenderAction * renderaction = window[i]->getGLRenderAction();
        #ifdef __COIN__
          /* In Coin, we have added an extension to SoGLCacheContextElement
             for getting a _guaranteed_ unique number for the cache contexts.
             That the original Inventor API is missing a function like this
             should be considered an ugly flaw in the design. */
            uint32_t uniqcc = SoGLCacheContextElement::getUniqueCacheContext();
        #else // SGI or TGS Inventor
          /* Use a "pseudo-random" number and cross your fingers that it's
             unique, since there's no decent method in the API from which
             the application programmer can get a unique cache context id. */
            uint32_t uniqcc = 19720408 + i;
        #endif // SGI / TGS Inventor
            renderaction->setCacheContext(uniqcc);
          }

        This is taken care of automatically by Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies's
        SoQt / SoGtk / SoXt / SoWin / Sc21 libraries, so you shouldn't
        have to worry about it unless you are making your own GUI
        binding to Coin from scratch.


Q2.3:   Why does my Visual C++ program using Coin work for debug builds but
        not for release builds?

A:      The MS Visual C++ compiler changes behaviour when you change between
        DEBUG and RELEASE mode.  Initialization of variables is one thing
        in particular you should look at - debug compilation will cause
        all variables to be initialized to zero, while they will have random
        values for release builds.

        There are of course other possible causes as well.


Q2.4:   I try to change the SoText2/SoText3 font, but nothing happens.
        Why, oh why?

A:      The font support prior to Coin 2.1 was limited to a hardcoded font
        for both Text2 and Text3. TrueType 2D fonts support were
        implemented in Coin 2.1 and 3D fonts in Coin 2.2.

        On Windows platforms, TrueType fonts are imported by utilizing
        the native support for this in the operating system. No such
        native TrueType support exists on UNIX and UNIX-like systems,
        so these platforms will use the FreeType library
        <URL:http://www.freetype.org>.

        If your requested font could not be found, try to set the
        environment variable COIN_DEBUG_FONTSUPPORT to 1. Extensive
        debug information will then be forwarded to the console. This
        includes info on which font library is being used, and whether
        Coin could locate the requested font or not, and where it
        looked.

        When using the FreeType library, requested fonts will first be
        searched for in the working directory. The path specified by
        the COIN_FONT_PATH environment variable will then be
        searched. It is not possible to explicitly specify a font file
        when using the Win32 library as all font handeling must be
        done through the operating system.

        For more information, please read the API documention on SoFont.
        <URL:http://doc.coin3d.org/Coin/classSoFont.html>


Q2.5:   Where does the SoGuiExamples module install the programs?

A:      They are not installed.  The programs are just examples, and do not
        belong with the installed executables on a system.  They are built
        in the build dir, and are intended to be run from there.


Q2.6:   Why can't any of the transparency modes be perfect?

A:      See the documentation on SoGLRenderAction::TransparencyType, at

          http://doc.coin3d.org/Coin/classSoGLRenderAction.html

        For Coin 2.3, a new transparency mode called SORTED_LAYERS_BLEND
        has been implemented for SoGLRenderAction which uses a technique
        that actually produces correct transparency rendering.  

        For earlier versions of Coin, transparency rendering will often
        fail and produce visual artifacts because blending is done in an
        incorrect order.  To avoid visual artifacts, all polygons must be
        rendered in sorted back-to-front order, and intersecting polygons
        must be clipped against each other.  This is in general too
        expensive an operation to use in a real-time system, so it was
        not implemented.

        Note that there is a transparency mode called "SCREEN_DOOR" that
        does not rely on blending - it uses dithering - that has been in
        Coin since v1.0.  This transparency mode always produces correct
        results, it doesn't even require multipass rendering, but since the
        visual result looks somewhat dated people seem to prefer the
        blending techniques.


Section 3. Other Hows and Whys
==============================

Q3.1:   Why is the .so-version 40 for Coin 2.0 and 60 for Coin 3.0?

A:      This was done to keep the artificial mapping we have constructed
        between the release version number and ABI interface version of Coin
        as simple as possible.  We have this mapping because we plan to
        do parallel development of different Coin-versions at the same time
        because Coin 1.0 has special status as the Open Inventor 2.1
        compatibility release.

        Keep in mind that .so-version numbers and release version numbers
        really do not have anything to do with each other in the first place.

        When you release a new major version of a library, you usually
        break compatibility with earlier versions of the library.  When you
        change the API/ABI of a library, you increment the interface number
        to indicate that the library has a new interface.  Since we want to
        continue development of Coin 1.0 after Coin 2.0 is released, we need
        to reserve space for future Coin 1.x releases, and set the Coin 2.0
        interface number after the reserved space.  We decided 20 interface-
        numbers would suffice for each major version of the Coin library,
        and the simplest equation for finding the interface number became
        major*20+minor.

        Incidentally, a lot of platforms (Linux included) calculate the
        .so-number by taking the interface number and subtracting the age,
        and the age is the same as the minor release version number for
        Coin.  This will make the .so-number stay at 20 for the whole 1.x
        series and similarly stay at 40 for the whole 2.x series, which of
        course looks silly, but that's the way it is.

        See also the Libtool manual, section about Versioning.  It's the
        same system, except that we have added reserved space in our scheme.
