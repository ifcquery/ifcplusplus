This file contains the textual explanations for errors that can occur when
configure is run.  The correct message is automatically extracted and dumped
on the screen by the configure script.

!too-old-qt
Versions of the Qt library older than version 2.0.0 is not supported.
You must upgrade to be able to build and use this software package.

!no-moc
Found no manner in which the Qt ''moc'' utility could be run. Make
sure Qt is properly installed on your system.

Did you perhaps forget to set up the environment variable QTDIR to the
base of the Qt installation directory? Or if it was already set up,
double check to see that it is pointing at the correct directory.

!no-uic
Found no manner in which the Qt ''uic'' utility could be run. Make
sure Qt is properly installed on your system.

Did you perhaps forget to set up the environment variable QTDIR to the
base of the Qt installation directory? Or if it was already set up,
double check to see that it is pointing at the correct directory.

!no-uic3
Found no manner in which the Qt4 ''uic3'' utility could be run. Make
sure Qt4 is properly installed on your system.

Did you perhaps forget to set up the environment variable QTDIR to the
base of the Qt installation directory? Or if it was already set up,
double check to see that it is pointing at the correct directory.

!no-rcc
The Qt ''rcc'' utility was not found in the same directory as the
other Qt utilities such as ''moc'' or ''uic''. Make sure Qt is
properly installed on your system.

!no-qt
Could not find any way to build against the Qt library. If you
are sure Qt is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

One common way to solve this problem is to set up the environment
variable QTDIR to the base of the Qt installation directory. Or if it
was already set up, double check to see that it is pointing at the
correct directory.

Note that it is possible to override the combinations of Qt libraries
configure tries to link against by setting up the environment variable
CONFIG_QTLIBS. This might be necessary if you have installed the Qt
library in a manner that is not compatible with any of the known
configurations, for instance by changing the name of the library or
the Qt library having more dependencies on other libraries that we are
aware of.

If you for instance know the correct set of libraries to be qt304.lib,
qtmain.lib and gdi32.lib (this would be on an MSWindows system), then
set CONFIG_QTLIBS to the string ''-lqt304 -lqtmain -lgdi32'' before
re-running configure.

If you still can't get the configure script to detect the presence of
and how to use the Qt library, please mail the config.log file to
<coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for help.

!no-pkgconfig-qt
Could not gather the configure flags for Qt through pkg-config. Please
ensure that the qt pkg-config metadata .pc files, such as QtCore.pc,
exist on your system. In case the metadata .pc files are installed
into a non-default location verify that the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable points to the correct directory.

Further details in how to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
can be found in the pkg-config(1) man page.

!no-gdiplus
Could not find a way to build against GDI+ (GdiPlus.h / -lgdiplus).
GDI+ is part of the Microsoft Windows SDK download.  Make sure you have
the MS Windows SDK set up correctly for your compiler.

For MinGW builds, install Alf P. Steinbach's GDI+ MinGW bindings and
rename lib/gdiplus.import.a to lib/gdiplus.a in the MinGW path.

See http://alfps.izfree.com/libraries/cpp/gdiplus_for_mingw/ for
MinGW download information.

!no-qgl
The configure script could not find any way to build code which uses
Qt's OpenGL bindings (called "QGL"), neither as part of the main Qt
library, nor as a stand-alone library.

You must install a Qt library configured with OpenGL support to be
able to resolve this problem.

If you are *sure* that Qt has been built with OpenGL support and you
still can't get the configure script to detect the presence of QGL,
please mail the config.log file to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask
for help.

!qt-install
The configure script picked out Qt's "install" program when trying to
find the system-wide "install" program.  This probably happened because
you have QTDIR/bin too early in the path.  During installation, you
would run into serious problems because of this.

Fix your PATH variable so the system-wide install program is found
instead of the Qt installer and re-run configure.

!no-msvc++
You need to have the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler suite accessible in the
Cygwin environment.  Read the file <srcdir>/README.WIN32.

If you are absolutely sure you want to attempt to run the configure script
and the build process without Microsoft Visual C++, and you know what you
are doing, use the ''--disable-msvc'' option to configure.

!cygwin-link
Cygwin's /usr/bin/link tool is earlier in the shell's PATH than MSVC's
link.exe.  Building would fail in the final stage because of this.

Fix your PATH variable so the MSVC link.exe program is found instead
of Cygwin's /usr/bin/link and re-run configure.

!c--inlinefor
This C++ compiler (\"$CXX\") does not seem to be capable of compiling
Coin, as it can't compile a simple test snippet with a for()-loop
within an inline function.

This check is primarily supposed to smoke out the useless gratis C++
compiler bundled by Hewlett-Packard along with HP-UX. If you get this
error message for other compilers, there might be something very wrong
with your local environment or compiler version.

(We've had error reports with this for g++ 2.95.3 on SuSe Linux, which
we have so far not been able to pin down to it's exact cause -- just
that it causes g++ to exit due to an internal compiler error, which is
of course a "should never happen" condition for any compiler. If you
are hit by this problem, try upgrading to a later g++ version.)

If you become stuck on this problem, please mail the config.log file
to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for help.

!c--vdest
This C++ compiler (\"$CXX\") is not capable of compiling Coin.

If you are using the Sun CC compiler, try upgrading to a new version,
or even downgrading to an older version.

If not, please mail the config.log file to <coin-support@coin3d.org>
and ask for help.

!c--fubarenvironment
Can't compile and/or link and/or run the simplest possible C++
source code. Something seems to be seriously wrong with your
development environment. This is a local problem you will have
to resolve before trying to build the library.

You may get clues to what is wrong by checking the config.log file
generated by the configure script in the build directory.

If it seems probable to you that you are getting this error due to a
error in the configure process, please mail the config.log file to
<coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for assistance.

!c--gcc296bug
Your compiler contains a nasty bug which makes it unsuited for
building this project.

If this is the GCC 2.96.x compiler shipped with Red Hat Linux, Red Hat
might provide updated RPMs of GCC without the bug. We strongly advise
you to upgrade before building *any* software on your system.

(gcc 2.96 was never really supported by the GCC team, as it was just a
snapshot taken from the development CVS repository by RedHat, then
branded as "version 2.96".)

If you can not find or install any updated version of the compiler,
you may try to re-run configure with the "--disable-optimization"
option, which should take care of the problem. Note that this will
have a negative impact on the Coin library's performance.

Another possibility is to change to a higher optimization level, as
only the default -O2 optimization level seems to exhibit this
particular bug. Note that you do so on your own risk, as there might
be gcc-bugs undetected by us for the higher optimization levels. If
you still want to go ahead with increasing the optimization level,
just set up the CPPFLAGS environment variable when invoking configure,
like this:

        # <srcdir>/configure [your-options] CPPFLAGS="-O3"


If this is *not* the GCC 2.96.x compiler, please mail the config.log
file to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for help.

!no-network-conversion
Could not find network conversion functions like htonl() and its variants.

On MSWindows systems, this can be caused by problems linking with the
winsock library (which is either in wsock32.dll or ws2_32.dll).

If you can't figure out what caused this problem, please mail the
config.log file to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for help.

!no-doxygen
Could not find the doxygen tool.
See http://www.doxygen.org for download information.

!no-opengl
Could not figure out how to use the OpenGL software development kit
on this system.

If you are sure OpenGL is actually installed and usable on this
system, and can't figure out why configure still can't use OpenGL,
please mail the config.log file to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask
for help.

!no-cpp-quoting
Couldn't figure out how to quote strings in CPP macros.

This is a freak condition. Please mail the config.log file to
<coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask for help.

!no-math-library
Could not find a way to use the math library.

Please mail the config.log file to <coin-support@coin3d.org> and ask
for help.

!invalid-msvcrt
Your choice for MSVC++ C library (the --with-msvcrt=<crt> option) was
invalid.  Use one of the following choices (aliases on the right):

  singlethread-static        [ /ml  | ml  | libc    ]
  singlethread-static-debug  [ /mld | mld | libcd   ]
  multithread-static         [ /mt  | mt  | libcmt  ]
  multithread-static-debug   [ /mtd | mtd | libcmtd ]
  multithread-dynamic        [ /md  | md  | msvcrt  ]
  multithread-dynamic-debug  [ /mdd | mdd | msvcrtd ]

!unable-to-run-soxx-config
configure was not able to find or run the required so*-config utility.

Note that the default So*-library to link against is the SoXt
library. If you want to use another library, for instance SoQt, you
need to specify this by an additional option to the configure script,
e.g.: ''--with-soqt''.

To be able to run the script, the <installdir>/bin/ installation
directory for the So*-library must also be set up in the shell's PATH
environment variable before invoking the configure script.

!unable-to-run-soqt-config
configure was not able to find or run the required soqt-config
utility.

To be able to run the script, the <installdir>/bin/ installation
directory for the SoQt-library must be set up in the shell's PATH
environment variable before invoking the configure script.

!x11-qt-but-no-x11-requested
You are using the X11 version of the Qt toolkit, but requested SoQt
to be built without X11 support. Please install Qt/Mac (if you don't
want X11 support) or specify --enable-darwin-x11 to use X11.

!mac-qt-but-x11-requested
You are using Qt/Mac but are trying to build
the X11-based version of SoQt. Please either install Qt/X11 or don't
specify --enable-darwin-x11.

!smallchange-unavailable
Could not build against the SmallChange library. If you are sure
SmallChange is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

!simaruba-unavailable
Could not build against the SIM Aruba library. If you are sure
SIM Aruba is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

!simvoleon-unavailable
Could not build against the SimVoleon library. If you are sure
SimVoleon is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

!soqt-unavailable
Could not build against the SoQt library. If you are sure
SoQt is properly installed on your system, see the file
config.log to find out what went wrong.

!spidermonkey-unavailable

Could not build against the SpiderMoneky library. Make sure the path
specified by --with-spidermonkey is correct. See the file config.log
for more information on what went wrong.
