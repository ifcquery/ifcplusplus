  \class SoGetMatrixAction SoGetMatrixAction.h Inventor/actions/SoGetMatrixAction.h
  \brief The SoGetMatrixAction class is an action for accumulating the transformation matrix of a subgraph.
  \ingroup actions

  This action makes it easy to calculate and convert to and from the
  global coordinate system of your scene and local coordinates of
  parts in a hierarchical model.

  As opposed to most other action types, the SoGetMatrixAction does
  not traverse children of the node it is applied to -- just the node
  itself. When applied to paths, it stops at the last node and does
  not continue further with the children of the tail node.

  Typical usage when querying for world space position, orientation
  and/or scaling would be as follows:

  \code

  // First get hold of an SoPath through the scenegraph down to the
  // node ("mynode") you want to query about its current world space
  // transformation(s).

  SoSearchAction * searchaction = new SoSearchAction;
  searchaction->setNode(mynode);
  searchaction->apply(myscenegraphroot);

  SoPath * path = searchaction->getPath();
  assert(path != NULL);

  // Then apply the SoGetMatrixAction to get the full transformation
  // matrix from world space.

  const SbViewportRegion vpr = myviewer->getViewportRegion();
  SoGetMatrixAction * getmatrixaction = new SoGetMatrixAction(vpr);
  getmatrixaction->apply(path);

  SbMatrix transformation = getmatrixaction->getMatrix();

  // And if you want to access the individual transformation
  // components of the matrix:

  SbVec3f translation;
  SbRotation rotation;
  SbVec3f scalevector;
  SbRotation scaleorientation;

  transformation.getTransform(translation, rotation, scalevector, scaleorientation);
  
  \endcode
*/


// Implementation note: nodes with special behavior on this action
// must set both the matrix and the inverse matrix explicitly, as no
// tracking is done to see when the matrices have been modified.
