  \class SoSearchAction SoSearchAction.h Inventor/actions/SoSearchAction.h
  \brief The SoSearchAction class provides methods for searching through scene graphs.
  \ingroup actions

  Nodes can be searched for by pointer, type, and name, or a
  combination of those criteria.  Types can be interpreted as exact
  types, or the type can match nodes derived from it.  Every single
  node can be searched, or normal traversal rules can be followed when
  searching (this is especially important to note with regard to
  switch nodes).

  When using more than one of the setNode(), setType() and setName()
  calls, note that the action will search for node(s) with an \c "AND"
  combination of the given search criteria.

  One of the most common pitfalls when using the SoSearchAction class
  is to call the function isFound() after doing a search.  It does not
  return what you would expect it to return if you haven't read the
  documentation for that function.

  Be aware that if you do search operations on an SoSearchAction
  created on the stack, you can get some unfortunate side effects if
  you're not careful. Since SoSearchAction keeps a list of the path(s)
  found in the latest search, the nodes in these paths will be
  unref'ed when the SoSearchAction stack instance is destructed at the
  end of your function. If the root of your scene-graph then has
  ref-count zero (it is often useful to do a unrefNoDelete() before
  returning a node from a function to leave the referencing to the
  caller), the root node will be destructed! It might be better to
  create a heap instance of the search action in those cases, since
  you'll then be able to destruct the search action before calling
  unrefNoDelete(). Another solution would be to call reset() before
  calling unrefNoDelete() on your object, since reset() truncates
  the path list.

  See the documentation of SoTexture2 for a full usage example of
  SoSearchAction.

  There is one frequently asked question about the paths that are
  returned from either this method or the getPaths() method below:
  "why am I not getting the complete path as expected?"

  Well, then you probably have to cast the path to a SoFullPath, since
  certain nodes (nodekits, many VRML97 nodes) have hidden
  children. SoPath::getTail() will return the first node that has
  hidden children, or the tail if none of the nodes have hidden
  children. SoFullPath::getTail() will always return the actual
  tail. Just do like this:
 
  \code
    SoFullPath * path = (SoFullPath *) searchaction->getPath();
    SoVRMLCoordinate * vrmlcord = (SoVRMLCoordinate *) path->getTail();
