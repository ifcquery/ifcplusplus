  \class SbLine SbLine.h Inventor/SbLine.h
  \brief The SbLine class represents a line in 3D space.
  \ingroup base

  SbLine provides a way of specifying a directed line, through a 3D
  point (origin) and a vector direction in 3D space.

  It is context dependent whether or not an SbLine is considered as a
  \e ray extending from the starting point in only one direction, or
  as a \e line intersecting the origin point and extending infinitely
  from it in both directions.

  SbLine is used by many other classes in Coin.

  Constructor with \a origin specifying the line origin point, and \a point
  specifying another point on the line that is used to determine the line's
  direction.  \a point should not be the same as \a origin, as this will
  lead to the line having a null vector as the direction vector.  This will
  cause division by zero problems in some of the other methods on this class.

  Be aware that the direction vector will be normalized and not be the same
  as \a point - \a origin.

  Method <em>setPosDir(position, direction)</em> should be preferred over a

  // From the discussion on getClosestPoint(), we know that the point

  //   Q0 = P0 + D0 * ----------
  //                     |D0|
  //
  // ...where P0 is a point on the first line, D0 is the direction
  // vector and Q1 is the "closest point" on the other line. From this
  // we get two equations with two unknowns. By substituting for
  // Q1 we get a new equation with a single unknown, Q0:
  //
  //                   (         (Q0 - P1)·D1    )
  //                   (P1 + D1 * ------------ - P0) · D0
  //                   (             |D1|        )
  //   Q0 = P0 + D0 * ------------------------------------
  //                                |D0|
  //
  // Which obviously is bloody hard (perhaps impossible?) to solve
  // analytically. Damn. Back to the pen and pencil stuff.
  //
  // Ok, new try. Since we're looking for the minimum distance between the
  // two lines, we should be able to solve it by expressing the distance
  // between the points we want to find as a parametrized function and
  // take the derivative:
  //
  //   f(t0, t1) = |Q1 - Q0| = |P1+D1*t1 - (P0+D0*t0)|
  //
  //                         (t1*D1 - P0)·D0
  // t0 can be expressed as  ---------------  which gives us
  //                               |D0|
  //
  //   f(t) = |P1 + D1*t - P0 - D0N * ((t*D1 - P0)·D0)|, t = t1
  //                                                     D0N = D0 normalized
  //                               _____________
  // ..which is eual to   f(t) = \/Þ² + ß² + ð²  , where Þ, ß, and ð
  // is the full expression above with the x, y, and z components
  // of the vectors.
  //
  // Since we're looking for the minimum value of the function, we can just
  // ignore the square root. We'll do the next parts of the math on a
  // general components case, since it's the same for the x, y and z parts.
  //
  // Expanding any of the Þ, ß, or ð expressions, we get this:
  //   (P1[i] - D1[i]*t - P0[i] - D0N[i]*D0[x]*D1[x]*t + D0N[i]*D0[x]*P0[x]
  //      - D0N[i]*D0[y]*D1[y]*t + D0N[i]*D0[y]*P0[y] - D0N[i]*D0[z]*D1[z]*t
  //      + D0N[i]*D0[z]*P0[z])² ,
  // where i=[x|y|z].
  //
  // Derivating this by using the chain rule (i.e. g(t)² =
  // 2*g(t)*g'(t)), we'll get this equation for finding the t yielding
  // the minimum distance between two points Q0 and Q1 on the lines:
  //
  //      -(cx*dx+cy*dy+cz*dz)
  //  t = --------------------
  //        dx² + dy² + dz²
  //
  //  di = D1[i] - D0N[i] * (D0[x]*D1[x] + D0[y]*D1[y] + D0[z]*D1[z])
  // and
  //  ci = P1[i] - P0[i] + D0N[i] * (D0[x]*P0[x] + D0[y]*P0[y] + D0[z]*P0[z])
  // where i=[x|y|z].
  //
  // Now we'll substitute t back in for t1 in   Q1 = P1 + D1*t1, which'll
  // also let us find Q0 by an invocation of getClosestPoint().
  //
  // That's it. I can't believe this took me 4 hours to complete. Code worked
  // on the first run, though. :-)
