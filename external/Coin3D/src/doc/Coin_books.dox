  \page Coin_books Books Related to Open Inventor / Coin

  Here is a list of some of the better books for people that invested
  in software development with Open Inventor.  If you have suggestions
  for additional books that ought to go on this list, please feel
  free to tell us about it.


  \section mentorbook The Inventor Mentor
  (subtitle "Programming Object-Oriented 3D Graphics with Open Inventor")

  This is an excellently written, detailed, tutorial-style
  introductory book for Open Inventor that takes you through all the
  fundamental design principles applied in the Open Inventor API,
  richly illustrated and with numerous, well documented code examples.

  The Inventor Mentor is getting a bit old, but do not let that put
  you off.  It is as valid today as it was the day it was written, and
  we heartily recommend this book for anyone learning to use
  Open Inventor.

  ISBN 0-201-62495-8.  You might also be able to find this book as a
  pdf file online, but we recommend having it in print.

  
  \section toolmakerbook The Inventor Toolmaker

  This book explains how Open Inventor was designed for being extended
  by the users, and walks you through how to develop your own
  components that work with all aspects of Coin.

  ISBN 0-201-62493-1.  You might also be able to find this book as a
  pdf file online, but we recommend having it in print.


  \section vrml2refbook The Annotated VRML2.0 Reference Manual

  This book covers the VRML97 (aka VRML 2.0) standard, which Coin has
  implemented with its Inventor/VRMLnodes/ classes, which is an
  extension made beyond the Open Inventor V2.1 API.

  The VRML97 format has some significant differences from the Inventor
  and VRML1 formats, so it is a useful book if you want to use that
  part of Coin.

  ISBN 0-201-41974-2.  You will find the specification documents for
  VRML97 online at <http://www.web3d.org/>.


  \section openglbook The Open GL Programming Manual

  This is the bible when it comes to OpenGL programming and is
  relevant for Open Inventor extenders that develop new nodes that
  implement or affect Open Inventor OpenGL rendering.  There are many
  editions of this book since it is updated whenever new versions of
  OpenGL are standardized and comes out, so check that you have
  identified the latest edition if you order one.


  \section oirefbook The Open Inventor C++ Reference Manual

  Although this book is directly relevant for Open Inventor, it does
  only cover the Open Inventor 2.1 API.  This information is more or
  less also covered in the online doxygen doc for Coin, where you have
  it hyperlinked, and can also be generated offline from the Coin
  sources to have locally, so we do not think this book is very useful
  to have in print.  We mention it anyway since it is an official
  documentation book for Open Inventor.

  ISBN 0-201-62491-5.
