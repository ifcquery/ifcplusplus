  \class SoHandleBoxManip SoHandleBoxManip.h Inventor/manips/SoHandleBoxManip.h
  \brief The SoHandleBoxManip class wraps an SoHandleBoxDragger for manipulating a transformation.
  \ingroup manips

  A manipulator is used by replacing the node you want to edit in the
  graph with the manipulator. Draggers are used to manipulate the
  node. When manipulation is finished, the node is put back into the
  graph, replacing the manipulator.
