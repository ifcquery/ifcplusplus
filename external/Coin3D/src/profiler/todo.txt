GLRender profiling, pr nodetype
===============================

* shrink the inventormaps.cpp file to a more sensible size

* GLRender profile into SoVRMLShape og SoVRMLParent

* Test GLRender profiling into SoBaseKit kit nodes

  => works, but the SoBaseKit-derived node will get accumulated time
     from its children.

* bug: SoSeparator nodes (and more rare; SoGroup nodes) sometimes
  comes out with large negative timing values. i believe i know why it
  happens; we don't catch the GLRenderBelow/In/OffPath() stuff in
  SoSeparator.

* User-settable flag (envvar?) for triggering continous redrawing

Scenegraph visualizer
=====================

* (optional) annotation of nodes with their type and name.


Clean-up
========

* collect common profiling code from SoNode, SoGroup and SoSeparator's
  GLRender*() methods, as the start and stop timing code is almost
  identical -- plus, it'd make it easier to straighten out the bugs.


Ideas for profiling targets
===========================

* track and show information about view frustum culling. should be
  easy to track, as i believe this info can be had from a single spot,
  or at least just a few spots, in the Coin source code
  (SoSeparator::GLRender(), perhaps also SoSeparator::rayPick()?)

  idea from rolvs for visualization: show culled parts with
  semi-transparent material settings in the NodeVisualizer

* time full action traversals. display as a "scrolling bar-chart",
  color-coded according to action-type.

* SoGroup children traversal timings (all actions), visualize as a
  color-coded, annotated scenegraph, with nodes that can be expanded
  and contracted.

  (mortene working on the data gathering, rolvs is working on the
  visualization part)

  => data gathering done

* memory usage in sub-graphs, same visualization as previous item.

  one idea how to do this: check child nodes' list of fields,
  calculate size based on getNum() and what we know about the types
  (SoMFFloat is eg getNum() * 4 bytes, SoMFVec3f is getNum() * 3 *
  4).

* memory usage for internal caches:
        - VBOs
        - textures
        - GL displaylists
        - ...more? snoop around, plus ask pederb

* Notifications and field connections

  It should be possible to expand the 3D scene graph viewer to also
  display field connections as extra lines between nodes that
  contains connected fields. In addition it would be really cool if
  we could visualize notifications in some way, both up through the
  hierarchy and through field connections. That would make it
  possible to identify parts of the scene graph that generates lots
  of notifications.

* a wish from some Simian, i don't remember who: include an option to
  show a profile of which SoSeparator nodes caches its children /
  subtrees. (i believe this would primarily be useful to quickly
  recognize spots in the scenegraph where there is _unwanted_ caching,
  which fairly often caused problems.)

  => FIXED on the profiling side, ie supported by SoProfilerElement
     and the instrumentation in SoSeparator is done.

  => UPDATE: now shown in the NodeVisualizer, probably still needs
     some debugging & other work.
