  \class SoFieldSensor SoFieldSensor.h Inventor/sensors/SoFieldSensor.h
  \brief The SoFieldSensor class detects changes to a field.
  \ingroup sensors

  Attach a field to a sensor of this type to put it under
  surveillance, so you can act upon changes to the field.

  An SoFieldSensor can also act for delete-callback purposes alone and
  does not need a regular notification-based callback.

  Attach sensor to a field. Whenever the field's value changes, the

  A field sensor can be attached to only a single field at a

  call will replace the field the sensor is monitoring with the new \a
  field.

  When the given field is deleted, the sensor will automatically be
  detached.
