  \class SoIdleSensor SoIdleSensor.h Inventor/sensors/SoIdleSensor.h
  \brief The SoIdleSensor class is a sensor which will trigger as soon as the application is idle.
  \ingroup sensors

  An SoIdleSensor differs from an SoOneShotSensor in that it will not
  trigger if the delay queue processing is occurring due to the delay
  queue timeout, but \e only when the application is idle.
