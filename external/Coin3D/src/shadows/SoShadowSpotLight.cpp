  \class SoShadowSpotLight SoShadowSpotLight.h Inventor/annex/FXViz/nodes/SoShadowSpotLight.h
  \brief The SoShadowSpotLight class is a node for setting up a spot light which casts shadows.

  This node can be used instead of a normal SpotLight if you need to
  improve the performance by supplying a simplified scene graph to be
  used when rendering the shadow map(s). For instance, the shadow map
  scene graph doesn't need any textures or materials, and any
  non-casters can also be excluded from this scene graph. It's more
  optimal to use this node than to use the SoShadowStyle node to
  control this, at the cost of some extra application complexity.

  It's especially useful if you have a scene with few shadow caster
  nodes and lots of shadow receiver nodes.

  Currently, this node must be placed somewhere in the SoShadowGroup
  subgraph to cast shadows.

  <b>FILE FORMAT/DEFAULTS:</b>
  \code
    ShadowSpotLight {
      shadowMapScene NULL
      nearDistance -1
      farDistance -1
    }
  \endcode

  Here is the the example from SoShadowGroup, modified to use SoShadowSpotLight
  instead of a normal SoSpotLight. Notice that only the sphere casts shadows.

  \code

  DirectionalLight { direction 0 0 -1 intensity 0.2 }

  ShadowGroup {
    quality 1 # to get per pixel lighting

    ShadowSpotLight {
      location -8 -8 8.0
      direction 1 1 -1
      cutOffAngle 0.35
      dropOffRate 0.7

      shadowMapScene
      DEF sphere Separator {
          Complexity { value 1.0 }
          Material { diffuseColor 1 1 0 specularColor 1 1 1 shininess 0.9 }
          Shuttle { translation0 -3 1 0 translation1 3 -5 0 speed 0.25 on TRUE }
          Translation { translation -5 0 2 }
          Sphere { radius 2.0 }
        }
    }
    # need to insert the sphere in the regular scene graph as well
    USE sphere

    Separator {
      Material { diffuseColor 1 0 0 specularColor 1 1 1 shininess 0.9 }
      Shuttle { translation0 0 -5 0 translation1 0 5 0 speed 0.15 on TRUE }
      Translation { translation 0 0 -3 }
      Cube { depth 1.8 }
    }
    Separator {
      Material { diffuseColor 0 1 0 specularColor 1 1 1 shininess 0.9 }
      Shuttle { translation0 -5 0 0 translation1 5 0 0 speed 0.3 on TRUE }
      Translation { translation 0 0 -3 }
      Cube { }
    }

    Coordinate3 { point [ -10 -10 -3, 10 -10 -3, 10 10 -3, -10 10 -3 ] }
    Material { specularColor 1 1 1 shininess 0.9 }

    Complexity { textureQuality 0.1 }
    Texture2 { image 2 2 3 0xffffff 0x225588 0x225588 0xffffff }
    Texture2Transform { scaleFactor 4 4 }
    FaceSet { numVertices 4 }
