  \class So@Gui@FullViewer So@Gui@FullViewer.h Inventor/@Gui@/viewers/So@Gui@FullViewer.h
  \brief The So@Gui@FullViewer class adds some user interface components to the viewer canvas.
  \ingroup components viewers

  The So@Gui@FullViewer is an abstract viewer class which extends it's
  superclass (the basic So@Gui@Viewer class) with two major user
  interface additions:

  <ul>

  <li>decorations around the render canvas, with buttons and
  thumbwheels to control camera interaction and various other aspects
  of model / scene viewing</li>

  <li>a popup menu, invoked with the right mouse button, which
  controls yet more aspects of the rendering and the viewer</li>

  </ul>

  The user interface features listed above are the common parts of the
  user interfaces of the So@Gui@FullViewer's non-abstract subclasses.

  For "real" application programs, the viewers / components from this
  class onwards and further down in the inheritance hierarchy is
  usually not all that interesting, as they enforces too much extra
  user interface cruft not compatible with the look and feel of the
  other parts of the application user interface. So most "real"
  applications will use either the So@Gui@Viewer or the
  So@Gui@RenderArea as their base-level component, and then inherit
  one of these down into one's own "proper" viewer classes.

  The non-abstract subclasses of the So@Gui@FullViewer class are
  viewer components often used as a test-bed for prototyping / rapid
  application development when doing quick testing of scenes,
  stand-alone 3D-models, animation techniques, etc etc.

  \fn void So@Gui@FullViewer::createViewerButtons(@WIDGET@ parent, SbPList * buttonlist)

  Set up the viewer buttons with pixmaps and event connections.


  One important note if you want to override this method to add your
  own buttons to the list (in the explanation below, it is assumed
  that you know how virtual function table pointers are handled by
  C++):

  createViewerButtons() is called (indirectly) from the constructors
  of the viewer classes. This means that you need to delay it's
  invocation until your own subclass's constructor is run, because
  otherwise your re-implementation won't have been added to the
  internal virtual function table yet.

  Delaying a superclass viewer from building it's decorations is done
  by passing build==FALSE as the last argument of the protected
  constructors. You will then have to explicitly trigger the building
  in your own constructor.

  Here's a minimal example that shows the steps needed to be able to
  override createViewerButtons() from So@Gui@ExaminerViewer:

  \code
  class MyExaminerViewer : public So@Gui@ExaminerViewer {
  
  public:
    MyExaminerViewer(@WIDGET@ parent);
  
  protected:
    virtual void createViewerButtons(@WIDGET@ parent, SbPList * buttonlist);
  };
  
  MyExaminerViewer::MyExaminerViewer(@WIDGET@ parent)
    : So@Gui@ExaminerViewer(parent, NULL, TRUE,
                            So@Gui@FullViewer::BUILD_ALL, So@Gui@FullViewer::BROWSER,
                            // build == FALSE, to delay creation of decorations
                            FALSE)
  {
    // Explicitly trigger the construction of viewer decorations.
    @WIDGET@ widget = this->buildWidget(this->getParentWidget());
    this->setBaseWidget(widget);
  }
  
  void
  MyExaminerViewer::createViewerButtons(@WIDGET@ parent, SbPList * buttonlist)
  {
    So@Gui@ExaminerViewer::createViewerButtons(parent, buttonlist);
    // [now add your own button(s) to the buttonlist]
  }
  \endcode

  One important note as for when you want to override this function in
  a subclass: be aware that it will usually be invoked (indirectly)
  from this class's constructor. That is \e before the table of
  virtual function pointers has been set up for the subclass, and
  because of this, the function will not be called in the subclass
  even though it is virtual.

  To make the overriding actually be in effect, you need to delay
  building the widgets of this class. For information on how to do
  that, see the documentation of
  So@Gui@FullViewer::createViewerButtons().
